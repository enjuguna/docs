# Extending & Customizing

## Adding New Models

- Create a valid CSV file in [`models/`](models/) directory for each new inverter model.
- Reference existing model files for correct column layout and formatting.

## Hardware Integration

- To enable real Modbus register reading, API should be extended with proper hardware libraries (current implementation is mock/simulated).
- Confirm Modbus hardware is supported and required libraries are available.

## Authentication Enhancements

- To provide login protection via the API, add JWT middleware in backend API server.
- Update frontend [`AuthContext.tsx`](frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:1) to support new authentication flows.

## Remote Site Connection

- Ensure tokens are correct for each remote site.
- Confirm API endpoints are reachable and network/firewall policies allow connection requests.

**Notes:**
- CSV definitions for models and inverters should be consistent to ensure smooth operation.
- Always back up CSV files before making bulk changes.
- Custom integration may require changes to both frontend and backend codebases.
