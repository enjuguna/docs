# Security, Performance, and Production Notes

## Security

- API authentication is disabled by default for development; enable JWT or API keys for production use.
- Tokens are required for remote site featuresâ€”store and share securely.
- Limit API exposure to only trusted networks for safety.

## Performance and Reliability

- Backend/data is lightweight: flat CSV for easy migration and backup.
- For persistent Windows service, consider using NSSM or equivalent service manager.
- Desktop (Electron) mode enables reliable offline access.

## Networking

- Only use required ports:
    - Backend: 3031
    - Frontend: 8080 (or Electron local)
    - Modbus: 502
- Always configure firewall exceptions for required ports.
- Block unused or unnecessary ports in production.

## Deployment Guidance

- Regularly back up all CSV storage folders.
- Regenerate and redeploy backend executable after code changes.
- Validate environment meets all prerequisites prior to deployment (OS, folder layout, executable presence).
- Consider network policy and access rights for remote and Modbus use.

**Notes:**
- Enable security features before moving application to live usage.
- Document all local changes and procedures for future maintenance.
