## Support

For bugs or modification requests:

- Check logs (see [`logs/application.log`](logs/application.log:1)) for error info.
- Review API documentation ([`api/README.md`](api/README.md:1)) for endpoint usage.
- Consult frontend configuration and CSV layouts for data validation issues.
- Regenerate `inverter_server.exe` if backend code is changed for updates to take effect.

For standard help:
- Consult the Help menu in the UI
- Contact your system administrator for advanced troubleshooting

**Notes:**
- User support should begin with application logs and API documentation for deepest insight.
