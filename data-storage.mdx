# Data Storage, Exports, and Workflows

## Storage System

- All dynamic data is stored in CSV files:
    - Inverters: [`inverters/inverters.csv`](inverters/inverters.csv:1)
    - Models: [`models/{modelname}.csv`](models/)
    - Tests: [`tests/test_devices.csv`](tests/test_devices.csv:1), [`tests/test_registers.csv`](tests/test_registers.csv:1)
    - Results: [`results/{modelname}_results.csv`](results/)
    - Logs: [`logs/application.log`](logs/application.log:1)
- For backup, copy CSV folders regularly.
- When a new model is created, a CSV is made in `models/` and available for selection.
- System reads/writes via API; frontend flushes changes automatically.

## Exporting Results

- Use Verification/Remote tab to export CSVs.
- API format: POST to `/api/v1/export` with options (file type, include logs, date range).
- Downloaded files include all selected/filter data.

## Workflows

- Adding inverters, models, tests, verification, and remote data always results in immediate CSV persistence.
- Regularly export and archive results as needed for backup and reporting.

**Notes:**
- CSV data storage ensures portability, easy archiving/migration, and transparency.
- Always ensure folder and file write access for best stability.
